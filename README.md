**REASON FOR CHOOSING THIS TOPIC AND LANGUAGE**

I like cryptography ; did my intership in crypto and now doing my minor project on cloud based encryption and so this topic was my first choice.
Python is easy to use , quick, and my project uses libraries supported by both linux and windows and hence its platform independent. Its not at all verbose like Java and comes with lot of functionalities and features.
